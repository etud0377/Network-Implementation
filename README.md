# Network-Implementation
 This program allows you to track all of the company's servers.  This object oriented program allows the user to enter server name, what kind of     operating system they use, hard drive capacity, and level of usages. The user must select f or w for which option they want to choose. If they choose    f, it will lead to file server which asks for all the previous inputs, as well as, number of user account and level of usage * 0.05. If they choose w,     it will lead to web server which asks for programming langauges that need at least two. They can't add more than five languages and the level of usage * 20.     It will then ask the user if they want to continue adding more servers. If they press n, the user will be prompted a display message that     has all the information that was added and the calculated level of usages. The maximum number of servers are 206. And over 5000 user accounts      is the maximum.
